This project has 2 stages:
1. Data engineering<\br>
I had to deal with many categorical features of this dataset. The hardest part in project was dimesionality reduction. By using correlation matrix and domain knowledge, I selected features to use in models.
2. Model selection<\br>
There were 3 models used for predicting the target. Finally, **Random Forest** was chosen with mean squeare error: `4.786`
