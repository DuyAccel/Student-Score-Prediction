# This project has 2 stages:
## 1. Data exploration and engineering
I had to deal with *many categorical features* of this dataset. The hardest part in project was **dimesionality reduction**. By using correlation matrix and domain knowledge, I selected features to use in models.
## 2. Model selection
I chose 3 algorithms for this regression problem. *GridSearchCV* was used to estimate **best hyperparameters** of each model.
Finally, **Random Forest** was chosen with mean square error: `4.78638`
